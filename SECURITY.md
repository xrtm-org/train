## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of `xrtm-train` seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT report it via a public issue.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing moy@xrtm.org.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for the fix, usually within 30 days. We request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to remediate it.
